# gameMatcher
This repo is a student group project for the CS203 class (Yoobee Colleges, Auckland campus)

## Objective

To create a web ~~app~~ project that effectively matches gamers with games. 
1. Users take a gamer motivation test 
2. System takes their results as input into a recommendation system
3. Recommendation system predicts a list of games that match a user's 'gamer personality'
4. Users decide which games are/are not a match
5. System learns from the users' choices and adjusts future predictions based on similar users (collaborative filtering)

## Frameworks/Libraries

Django
